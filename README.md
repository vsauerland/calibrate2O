# calibrate2O

The package contains a parallel implementation of the Covariance Matrix
Adaption Evolution Strategy for Multiple Objectives (MO-CMAES) [IHR07].

PURPOSE
-------

This version is supposed to optimize the parameters of models w.r.t.
different targets simultaneously.
It is most suitable, if the model running time is approximately the same
for different parameter sets.
